// Real data, fetched from Orphadata (free, no API key — see README) via
// `npm run fetch-data`, which runs scripts/fetch-orphadata.mjs and writes
// diseases.generated.json. Don't hand-edit the generated file; re-run the
// script instead (e.g. after changing which classifications/caps it pulls).
//
// `note` is a short factual line built from real structured data (shown on
// search result cards) rather than an invented medical description — see
// buildNote() in the script. `definition` is Orphanet's own prose
// definition from product1, shown on the detail page only, or null where
// Orphanet has none. `externalLinks` are outbound references
// (Orphanet, OMIM, Monarch/MONDO, ICD-11) from the same product1 file.
//
// `inheritance` and `ageOfOnset` are arrays because a disease can have
// more than one documented value (e.g. onset varies by case) — each is
// its own facet value, not one composite string.
